We want our project to be a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone who wants to contribute. We ask that all members of our community follow these guidelines to ensure a safe and positive environment for all.

Guidelines

### Be respectful and kind

Treat others with kindness, respect, and empathy. Do not make personal attacks, use offensive language, or engage in any form of discriminatory behavior.

### Listen and be open-minded

Listen to the opinions and ideas of others, even if they differ from your own. Be open-minded and willing to consider alternative viewpoints.

Collaborate with others in a positive and constructive way. Do not engage in behavior that undermines the efforts of others or disrupts the project.

Assume that others are acting in good faith, even if you disagree with their actions or opinions. Give people the benefit of the doubt and seek to understand their perspectives.

### Respect privacy and confidentiality

Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. Do not share personal or sensitive information without their explicit consent.
